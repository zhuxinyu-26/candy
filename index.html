      <p>The gummy bear originated in Germany, where it is popular under the name audio speaker iconGummibär (gum or gummy bear), or in the endearing form audio speaker iconGummibärchen ([little] gum or gummy bear). </p>
      <p>Gum arabic was the original base ingredient used to produce the gummy bears, hence the name gum or gummy. Hans Riegel Sr., a confectioner from Bonn, started the Haribo company in 1920. In 1922, inspired by the trained bears seen at street
        festivities and markets in Europe through to the 19th century, he invented the Dancing Bear (Tanzbär), a small, affordable, fruit-flavored gum candy treat for children and adults alike, which was much larger in form than its later successor,
        the Gold-Bear (Goldbär). Even during Weimar Germany's hyperinflation period that wreaked havoc on the country, Haribo's fruit-gum Dancing Bear treats remained affordably priced for a mere one pfennig per pair at kiosks.</p>
      <p>The success of the Dancing Bear's successor would later become Haribo's world-famous Gold-Bears candy product in 1967.</p>

    <div>
      <p>The success of gummy bears has spawned the production of many other gummy candies made to resemble animals and other objects, such as rings, worms, frogs, snakes, hamburgers, cherries, sharks, penguins, hippos, lobsters, octopuses, apples,
        peaches, oranges, Ampelmännchen, Smurfs and spiders. Manufacturers offer a range of sizes including bears that weigh several kilograms.</p>
      <p>In the United States, Haribo gummy bears are sold in five flavors: raspberry (red); orange (orange); strawberry (green); pineapple (colorless); and lemon (yellow). Trolli's bears are most often sold in five flavors in the United States, and
        in
        the same colors; however, Trolli's red bear is strawberry-flavored, while the green is lime and the colorless is grape. Many companies emulate either Haribo or Trolli flavor-color combinations. Health-oriented brands, which often use
        all-natural flavors, sometimes opt for more and different flavors. For example, the boxed bulk gummies sold by Sunflower/Newflower Markets include grape, pineapple-coconut and peach, among others.</p>

    <h3><a name="ingredientsAndProduction">Ingredients and production</a></h3>
    <div>
      <img class="bear-left" src="images/img3.jpeg" alt="gummy bear 3">
      <p>The traditional gummy bear is made from a mixture of sugar, glucose syrup, starch, flavoring, food coloring, citric acid and gelatin. However, recipes vary, such as organic candy, those suitable for vegetarians or those following religious
        dietary laws.</p>
      <p>Production uses a specialized machine called a starch mogul. The image of the gummy bear is stamped into a tray filled with powdered starch. The hot, liquid mixture is poured into the indentations in the starch and allowed to cool overnight.
        Once the mixture has set, the candies can be removed from the mold and packaged. The molds are open on top, so only the bear's front is formed while the back remains flat. The original design for each type of candy is carved into plaster by
        an
        artist, then duplicated by a machine and used to create the starch molds for the production line.</p>
      <p>Gummy bears made with bovine, porcine or piscine gelatin are not suitable for vegetarians and vegans. Those with porcine gelatin or from animals not slaughtered in either of the two contradictory ritualistic fashions do not conform to
        kashrut
        or halal dietary laws. In its factory in Turkey, Haribo produces halal bears and other sweets made with bovine gelatin. Also, some gummy bears are made with pectin or starch instead of gelatin, making them suitable for vegetarians.
      </p>
      <p>Large sour gummy bears are larger and flatter than regular ones, have a softer texture and include fumaric acid or other acid ingredients to produce a sour flavor. Some manufacturers produce sour bears with a different texture based on
        starch
        instead of gelatin. Typically, starch produces a shorter (cleaner bite, less chewy) texture than does gelatin.</p>
